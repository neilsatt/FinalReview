RESPONSIVE IMAGES ---------------------------------------------------------------------
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/responsive-images

HTML Attributes - srcset and sizes

HTML Element - picture

Srcset - We can provide multiple image sources for different
         reponsive resolutions and pixel densities. Use if changing resolutions. 

sizes - takes one of more CSS media conditions and ends with a length unit.
        This tells the browser how much space the image should take up in the layout.

Picturefill -  A responsive image polyfill. The picture element, srcset and sizes attributes, and associated features allow web developers to deliver an appropriate image to every user depending on a variety of conditions like screen size, viewport size, screen resolution, and more.


Responsive Images Quiz: -------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the primary advantages of using HTML elements and attributes for responsive images 
instead of CSS background images?
    Better for SEO, accessibility, and separation of structure and presentation

Why can 2x photographs have a higher amount of JPEG compression?
    When 2x images are resized in the layout, the scale of JPEG artifacts tends to be reduced.
    
What's the advantage of using HTML to deliver responsive images rather than a JavaScript library?
    HTML is faster - JS is more error prone than declarative HTML. 
    HTML allows content parsers to pick up images
    
What types of images work best as SVGs? - images that have large flat areas of color

What type of image is best delivered in JPEG format? - Photographs

In general, what's wrong with sending a single high resolution image to every device?
    Waster bandwidth, especially on 1x devices and smaller mobile screens
    


SrcSet with Picturefill Quiz: ----------------------------------------------------------------
When using the srcset attribute, it's up to browser vendors to make the most intelligent choice about which file to deliver. Why might this be desirable behavior when we could instead maintain full control over image source selection using the picture element?
    If browser vendors come up with a better way to choose sources or new devices come along, this
    keeps devs from having to figure out how to implement, since it will be handled by browsers. 

When using a polyfill, what happens to browsers that have native support for the polyfilled feature?
    Browsers that support our HTML natively will work as intended, and browsers that don't
    will use the polyfill. 
    
What is a polyfill?
    a piece of javascript that will make specific features work in older browsers that don't support them natively.

How does the srcset attribute differ from the src attribute?
    srcset allows use to specify multiple files for a single image. 



Srcset Challenge
Modify the srcset attribute so that the @2x image photo-@2x.jpg comes first:
          <div class="profile-image">
            <img
              srcset="photo-@2x.jpg 2x,
                      photo-@1x.jpg 1x"
              src="photo-@1x.jpg"
              alt="Photograph of a flower."
              />
          </div>



Adding Sizes Quiz: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sizes attribute: 
    The sizes attribute specifies the sizes of icons for visual media.
    This attribute is only used if rel="icon".

What does the sizes attribute indicate to the browser?
    How much space an image should take up in the layout
    
    
The sizes attribute takes one or more CSS media conditions and ending with a length unit:
    True
    
If an image is 1000px wide and displayed @2x, how many CSS pixels wide will it be in the layout?
    500px

What's the difference between the length values in the srcset attribute versus the media conditions and length values in the sizes attribute?
    The source set attribute tells the browser the native width of the image in pixels. 
    The sizes attribute tells the browser how much space that image will take up in the layout. 
    
    
Art Direction Quiz: --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
What is art direction? 
    Art direction is a technique for drawing attention to the most important parts of an image
    as it's viewed on different devices.
    
When using srcset on an image element, Chrome will always use the lowest resolution image in cache 
    False
    
Banner Image orientation is?
    Landscape
    
Challenge:
The <picture> element has two child <source> elements. In the first <source> element, add a media attribute with a value that will only use the source when in landscape orientation. The second <source> element should not be modified.
media="(orientation: landscape)"
