In general, responsive design consists of 
- Fluid grids 
- Fluid images
- Media queries


Relative Units and Percentages -------------------------------------------------------------
Quiz: 
Elements that use percentages are relative to their parent container

Instead of fixed units like pixels, what are the units of responsive design?
    Relative units like percentages or ems
    
ems - Equal to the computed value of the ‘font-size’ property of the element on which it is used.

Which of the following is a relative unit in CSS?
    em



Media Queries -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Media queries are CSS rules that help us include CSS code only when certain conditions are met. 
The media feature most commonly used is width, or more specifically, min-width.

Quiz:
What is a media feature?
    The expression or set of conditions inside a media query 

What are media queries?
    CSS rules that include CSS code only when certain conditions are met
    
Which is not a media feature?
    pixel
    
    
Breakpoints ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Breakpoint a width where the current layout no longer works and the layout breaks. 
If the layout breaks, then it necessitates a media query that adjusts the layout.

Quiz:
Breakpoint - any media query that adjusts the layout based on a certain width

Practical Cost of creating breakpoints?
    Each breakpoint slightly increases the complexity of design and code
    
Breakpoints should be created based on the width of popular screen sizes
    True
    
Why should breakpoints be used in combination with fluid grids? 
    In a mobile first approach, a single column layout won't look good when stretched
    across a large monitor. The layout breaks. 
    
    
Responsive Design Patterns ------------------------------------------------------------------   
Review Flexbox - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/flexbox-2

What is Flexbox?
    A collection of CSS properties for adjusting page layout based on different screen sizes.
    
In general, how many columns should be included in a portrait-mode mobile layout?
    Most mobile layouts are a single column, because of scrolling
    
Why is it important to create breakpoints based on content rather than based on popular 
device screen sizes?
    So they will be ready for devices/sizes that haven't been created yet. Future-proofing. 
    
Consider the following media query:
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px)
Will this media query be applied if the width of the browser is 768 pixels across?  
    Yes, min-width is inclusive
    
In computer programming, two common boolean operators are "and" and "or". Media queries 
use the keyword "and", but how could a media query represent an "or" if there's no keyword for it?
    Media queries can express and 'or' by using a comma to separate two different queries
