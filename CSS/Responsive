HTML Attributes - srcset and size

HTML Element - picture

Srcset - use if changing resolutions. The browser decides which is best. 

sizes - takes one of more CSS media conditions and ends with a length unit.
        This tells the browser how much space the image should take up in the layout.

PictureFill - a polyfill (piece of javascript) used to make sure pieces of HTML work in old browsers as well as current browsers.

SrcSet with Picturefill Quiz: ----------------------------------------------------------------
When using the srcset attribute, it's up to browser vendors to make the most intelligent choice about which file to deliver. Why might this be desirable behavior when we could instead maintain full control over image source selection using the picture element?
    If browser vendors come up with a better way to choose sources or new devices come along, this
    keeps devs from having to figure out how to implement, since it will be handled by browsers. 

When using a polyfill, what happens to browsers that have native support for the polyfilled feature?
    Browsers that support our HTML natively will work as intended, and browsers that don't
    will use the polyfill. 
    
What is a polyfill?
    a piece of javascript that will make specific features work in older browsers that don't support them natively.

How does the srcset attribute differ from the src attribute?
    srcset allows use to specify multiple files for a single image.
