var secret;
do {
  secret = prompt("What is the secret password?");    
} while ( secret !== "sesame" );
document.write("You know the secret password. Welcome.");

https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-arrays-and-loops/tracking-multiple-items-with-arrays/review-adding-and-removing-items-from-arrays
Shift vs. Unshift
    shift() - removes removes an item from the beginning of an array.
    unshift() - adds an item to the beginning of an array.

Alternate Object property notation: animal['weight'] = 770;

for in Property review:
var shanghai = {
  population: 14.35e6,
  longitude: '31.2000 N',
  latitude: '121.5000 E',
  country: 'CHN'
};
Version 1 - Properties Only 
for(var prop in shanghai) {
  console.log(prop); // logs out the properties, but not the value
}

Version 2 - Properties and Values
for(var prop in shanghai) {
  console.log(prop + ": " +shanghai[prop]);  // logs out "population: 14.35e6"
}


JS AND THE DOM --------------------------------------------
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-and-the-dom-2/getting-a-handle-on-the-dom/selection-review
How would you select the body element using document.getElementsByTagName, and store it in the variable body?
const body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]   


https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-and-the-dom-2/getting-a-handle-on-the-dom/selecting-multiple-elements
On line 1 of app.js, set the variable listItems to refer to a collection. The collection should contain all list items in the 
unordered list element with the id of rainbow.

listItems = document.querySelectorAll('#rainbow li');
const colors = ["#C2272D", "#F8931F", "#FFFF01", "#009245", "#0193D9", "#0C04ED", "#612F90"];

for(var i = 0; i < colors.length; i ++) {
  listItems[i].style.color = colors[i];    
}


https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-and-the-dom-2/traversing-the-dom/sibling-traversal
const list = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];

list.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.tagName == 'BUTTON') {
    var p = e.target.previousElementSibling; // ADD THE VAR DECLARATION!!!!
    p.className = 'highlight';
  }
});

// Assign all children of the UL to lis
const ul = document.getElementsByClassName('ul')[0];
const lis = ul.children;


https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-and-the-dom-2/traversing-the-dom/child-traversal
Get all the paragraph elements within section and assign them to the paragraphs variable.
const section = document.querySelector('section');
let paragraphs = section.children;
for(var i=0; i<paragraphs.length; i++){
 paragraphs[i].style.color = 'blue';  // ADD THE 'i' TO INCREMENT THROUGH ALL OF THE PARAGRAPHS
}


HTML REVIEW ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the difference between the length values in the srcset attribute versus the media conditions and length values in the sizes attribute?
    Source Set - native width of the image in pixels
    Sizes - how much space the image will take
